# UTA Code Server

This project, UTA Code Server, simplifies the deployment and demonstration of web applications directly in the cloud, allowing users to showcase their work with ease and efficiency.

## Description

The IDE Cloud Platform is designed to lower the barriers traditionally associated with deploying web applications. Its primary goal is to provide a seamless experience similar to running applications locally. Here are some key points about the project:

- **Ease of Use**: Users can deploy their web applications with minimal setup, making it easier to share and demonstrate their work publicly.
- **Accessibility**: The platform supports access from various devices, enabling developers to use even older hardware or mobile devices to manage their projects.
- **Innovation in Development**: Reflecting the future of cloud computing, where heavy lifting is done on the server side, this project allows developers to focus more on coding and less on the configuration.
- **Scalability**: Built on Google Cloud Run, the project harnesses the power of containerization, ensuring that applications scale effortlessly with demand.
